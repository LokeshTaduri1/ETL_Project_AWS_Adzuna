# From API to Dashboard: Building a Complete ETL Pipeline on AWS

This project shows how to build a full end-to-end data pipeline using **AWS services** ‚Äî from collecting raw job data to displaying it in a dashboard. We are using live job listings from the **Adzuna API**, transforming and loading the data into **Amazon Redshift Serverless**, and creating interactive dashboards with **Looker Studio**.

## üß≠ Project Flow

This project follows these main steps:

### Step 1: Extract Data  
- We use **AWS Glue (Python Shell Job)** to collect job listing data from the Adzuna API.
- The raw data is saved in **Amazon S3**.

### Step 2: Transform Data  
- The raw data is cleaned and formatted using **AWS Glue PySpark Job**.
- The transformed data is stored again in S3.

### Step 3: Load Data  
- The final data is loaded from S3 into **Amazon Redshift Serverless**.
- A Redshift schema is defined using SQL scripts.

### Step 4: Visualize Data  
- The Redshift database is connected to **Looker Studio** (Google‚Äôs BI tool).
- Dashboards are created to show job trends, salaries, and top hiring cities for Data Engineers in Canada.
